Project Resume: Victor Clavelly Music Web Player
What We've Built
A minimalist, interactive music player website with a vintage/mysterious UI, designed for both desktop and mobile, optimized for fast loading and low distractions.

The interface simulates a “machine” with physical-looking buttons, an animated splash/loading overlay, and custom navigation for music and project pages.

Main Features
Splash/Loading Screen: Custom hand-drawn image covers the app on load. Stays until all images/sounds are preloaded, then waits for a tap/click to enter the site.

Preloading: All UI images (frames, backgrounds, title cards, buttons) and all audio (sound FX, music tracks) are preloaded before the site starts to avoid lag/delays on first use.

No Scroll: The app locks the page scroll for a fullscreen "kiosk" feel.

Custom Buttons: Five touch/click zones mapped to PNG overlays, controlling play, pause, next track, next project, and a “page” panel.

Music/Project System: Each project (album/EP) contains a background image, a page image, and a playlist (music tracks, each with its own title image).

Sound FX: Button clicks and panel open/close play sound effects using Howler.js for reliable playback on both desktop and mobile.

“Page” Overlay: Button 5 toggles a project-specific “page” image panel, which overlays the player and can be dismissed by tapping/clicking.

Title Display: The current track’s title image is always shown. If the track changes, the previous title remains visible until the new image has fully loaded (no flicker).

Mobile First: Works reliably on iPhone, locks orientation (as much as web allows), disables pinch/zoom, and is touch-optimized.

How the Website Works (User Flow)
Landing/Splash: User sees the custom loading image. While assets preload, user can’t interact. Once loading is complete, tapping/clicking removes the splash.

Main UI: The “machine” interface appears, with a background image, a frame, title card, and five “button” hotzones (overlaid on the frame, invisible but clickable/tappable).

Buttons:

Play: Plays the current track.

Pause: Pauses playback.

Next Track: Skips to the next track in the current project playlist.

Next Project: Switches to the next project/album and starts from its first track.

Page (Button 5): Opens the “project page” overlay (shows a large PNG). Tapping anywhere closes it (with sound effect).

Audio: Each track has a corresponding music file; transitions never cause abrupt cut-off (waits for track/title to load).

No accidental scroll/zoom: User can’t scroll, zoom, or accidentally “leave” the player on mobile.

Technical Stack
Frontend: [Next.js 13+ App Router] (React-based framework)

TypeScript: For strict typing and code safety

Image Handling: next/image for optimized images

Audio: Howler.js for robust, mobile-friendly sound FX and playback

Styling: Inline styles + a tiny bit of Tailwind for body bg (you can expand to use more Tailwind if needed)

File Structure: All assets (music, images, sound FX) stored in /public/next/image/ and /public/music/ and /public/sounds/

No external DB: All project/playlist data is hardcoded as arrays (easy to expand)

Key Libraries/Dependencies
next (Next.js)

react and react-dom

howler (for sound)

(optional) @types/howler for TypeScript intellisense

Tips for Future Sessions / Cloning
Reuse the “Project/Playlist” structure to add new albums/projects. Just add new entries in the projects array with images, page overlays, and tracks.

All images/sounds referenced must exist in /public/next/image/ or /public/music/ for things to work reliably.

To avoid broken images: Double-check file names for case, spaces, typos (web servers are case sensitive).

If you want to add features (volume, scrub bar, more pages, etc.), just describe your change and paste this project sheet into a new chat for context.

How to Extend
More projects: Just add new objects to the projects array.

More tracks: Add more items to each project’s playlist.

New overlays/splash/animations: Replace images or add CSS keyframes as needed.

Advanced navigation: Can add swipe/keyboard support, or external links if wanted.

Accessibility: Can add ARIA labels and improve focus/keyboard nav.

Known Quirks
On some iPhones, audio playback may still require an initial user gesture to “unlock” sound (standard iOS policy).

next/image requires all images to be accessible and correctly referenced, otherwise you’ll see broken links.

Audio pool errors can occur on iOS if too many sound FX overlap (Howler limitation).

Code Organization
Everything is in src/app/page.tsx (for now).

You can modularize further (e.g., move components to /components) as your project grows.
